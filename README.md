A Very Smart Clock
==================

I wanted to tell the time, so I made an analog clock using a 3D printer,
a Raspberry Pi, some motors sensors and circuits.

This will always be a work in progress.

Bill of Materials
-----------------

* A [Raspberry Pi A+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-a-plus/)
  (this model is needed because of its low power consumption)
* 3 [10k OHM resistors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11508 foo)
* 3 [latching hall effect sensors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9312)
* 3 28BYJ-48 5V stepper motors and drivers,
  [you can get a bag of 5 on Amazon for cheap](https://www.amazon.com/USPRO-Stepper-28BYJ-48-4-Phase-ULN2003/dp/B00JB22IQC).
* A breadboard or some of my fancy custom PCBs (clockers.fzz)
* All kinds of jumper wires
* A 12" diameter acrylic disc, 3/8" thick. Or something similar to mount this whole thing on.
* 12 2" #6-32 metal screws with nylon nuts and washers.
* 16 1/2" #4-40 metal screws with nuts, flat washers and belleville washers.
